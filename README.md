Online catalogue for the technology enthusiasts
This is my project for the ReactJS module of Softuni in March 2021.
The purpouse of this project is for people to display their personal digital setup.

To start the project on your PC locally, you have to open it in VS Code, then open the terminal, then split terminal.
In the first terminal type "cd server" to navigate to the server folder. Then type "npm start" to start the server.
In the second terminal type "cd client" to navigate to the client folder. Then type "npm start" to start the client.
